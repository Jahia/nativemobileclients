Jahia Apache Cordova Example Projects Readme
============================================

Important Disclaimer (please read)
----------------------------------
The projects presented here are examples, that were established at a specific point in 
time along with a specific version of Jahia. These are not to be considered as Jahia 
products and therefore are not supported nor have any guarantees. If you need help with 
these examples, you can either ask questions in the Jahia Forums (www.jahia.com) or 
contract an assistance plan at support@jahia.com

Requirements
------------
- Jahia 6.6 or more recent, installed
- By default the example code is designed to work with Jahia Wise, which is not yet
  available at the time of writing this, but the code can be adapted to work with any
  Jahia website (simply modify the AJAX urls).
- Apache Cordova 1.8.1 or more recent : http://phonegap.com/download
- For iOS project, you will need to install XCode 4.3.3 on a Mac, https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
- For Android projects, you will need to install the Android SDK : http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
  and possibly also an Eclipse IDE : http://www.eclipse.org/
  
Getting started
---------------
1. Download and install mobile platform SDK (iOS requires a Mac, Windows Mobile requires a PC)
2. Download and install Apache Cordova
3. Create a native mobile project and install Cordova inside (see Cordova Getting Started Guides)
   at http://docs.phonegap.com/en/1.8.1/guide_getting-started_index.md.html
4. Copy example HTML, Javascript, CSS and image files over to project
5. In your project, open the index.html file and locate the hardcoded Jahia server URL
   and user name and password and adjust them to point to your Jahia server.
6. Customize the URLs and nodetypes inside the index.html and jahia-wise-1.0.js files
   to match the node types and data inside your Jahia server.
7. In your are using Jahia 6.6 and not a later version, copy the packaged base.full.jsp and 
   base.nodetype.jsp into your Jahia install at the following location (don't overwrite
   the files if they are already present !)
   
   modules/default/nt_base/json/
   
8. Customize, deploy and test !

Debugging
---------

Debugging can be more difficult than for a regular native application since the code is 
actually running inside the Javascript interpreter inside a web view. Apache Cordova does
redirect the Javascript console so you can use statements such as :

    console.log('Debug output')
    
You can then use the application in the Android or iOS simulators and you should see the
statements appear in the console panel of the IDE.

Be careful that lots of logging statements might slow down the execution of the code. 

If you need to really dig deep into the debugging and for example trace the Javascript 
execution, a tool is available only on the iOS platform (iOS 5 or more recent required) 
called iWebInspector: http://www.iwebinspector.com/
